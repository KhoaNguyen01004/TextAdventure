<h1>Text Adventure (Java)</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>

A fun and simple side project that help reinforce my Java knowledge. This project was inspired by an actual text-based game <b><i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i></b> by Crowther and Woods. Of course, this is a much more simple version compare to those game, but hard enough so I could practice my java code without quitting.
